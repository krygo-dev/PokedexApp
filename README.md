# PokedexApp
Pokedex app showing data about Pokemons from pokeapi.co. App covered with tests.

App idea and design belongs to philipplackner JetpackComposePokedex (https://github.com/philipplackner/JetpackComposePokedex).
I used his app as good starting point to improve my test writing skills.
I just changed design a little bit and added unit, UI and end to end tests.
